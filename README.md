My friend and I developed this game for our final project. It was my first real development experience in Unity, and I think we made a good game in just a few weeks.
As a programmer, of course, my main responsibility was coding. With a nice visual design and solid functionality, we were able to deliver a satisfying result.

We used the C# programming language and the Unity engine.

Our game includes two mods:
1. Runner mode:
   In Runner Mode, the rival AI throws balls at the player, and the player must dodge them for 30 seconds. The character has abilities such as dashing and time-slowing.
2. Thrower mode:
    In Thrower Mode, the player throws balls at three moving AIs for 3 rounds. You have 6 balls per round, so you must use them carefully. If you run out of balls before hitting all targets, you lose.
